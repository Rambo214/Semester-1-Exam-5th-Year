# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# if age >18 :

#### Create an empty list called squareNumbers (3 marks)
# squareNumbers = []
#### Square numbers are the solutions to a number being multiplied by itself( example 1 is a square number because 1 X 1 = 1, 4 is a square number because 2 X 2 = 4 ). 
###Calculate the first 20 square numbers and put them in the list called squareNumbers. (With loop and .append 10 marks, without, Max 6 marks).
# squareNumbers = [2, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400]

####Print your list (1 mark)
# print(squareNumbers)
####Create a variable called userSquare that asks the user for their favourite square number
# userSquare = input("Enter your favourite squared number: ")
# print(userSquare)


#### Add this variable to the end of your list called SquareNumbers
# userSquare = input("Enter your favourite squared number: ")
# squareNumbers = [2, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, (userSquare)]
# print(squareNumbers)
### Create a variable called choice. This variable should choose a random element from your list. Print the variable called choice.(3 marks)

####Create another print statement that prints tha following output: The random square number is: XX, where XX is where the random square number chosen by the computer.(4 marks)
# import random
# choice = int(random.choice(squareNumber))
# print(choice)
